Branching Strategy

I’ve adopted a simple method. There are three branches currently namely: main, development and features. 
1.Main Branch :
   - This is the safe version of your project that's always ready for use.
   - Think of it as the "official" version.

2. Development Branch :
   - This is where new stuff is added and tested.
   - It's like a playground for trying out new things.

3. Feature Branches :
   - Imagine these as separate workspaces for different ideas or changes.
   - You can make changes in these spaces without affecting the main version.
