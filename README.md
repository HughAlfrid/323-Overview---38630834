Project 1: 323 Overview

This repository will be used to track and provide an overview of the 4 projects being developed this semester. Each project will get their own repository name, (Project 2, Project 3, Project 4, Project 5).
This repository will hold presently the only the kanban project, which holds data pertaining to all projects and their dates, milestones and other information.


Branching Strategy

Iâ€™ve adopted a simple method. There are three branches currently namely: main, development and features. 
1.Main Branch :
   - This is the safe version of your project that's always ready for use.
   - Think of it as the "official" version.

2. Development Branch :
   - This is where new stuff is added and tested.
   - It's like a playground for trying out new things.

3. Feature Branches :
   - Imagine these as separate workspaces for different ideas or changes.
   - You can make changes in these spaces without affecting the main version.
